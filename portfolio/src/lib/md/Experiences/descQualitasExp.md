# Full-Stack Software Engineer

## Experience

Full-Stack Java Developer specializing in building enterprise-grade web applications with the Jakarta EE ecosystem.
Expertise in developing robust backend services with Oracle PL/SQL and creating dynamic, component-based user interfaces using JavaServer Faces (JSF). Proven ability to manage the full software development lifecycle, from database design to front-end implementation.
My key roles involve:

- _Technical Leadership & Architecture_ : As a key member of the technical team, I'm actively involved in the architectural planning and decision-making process for the platform's evolution and for a major codebase. Responsibilities included analyzing requirements to propose scalable solutions, leading design discussions on database optimization and API contracts, and making critical choices on technology adoption and implementation strategies. This ensured the codebase remained robust, performant, and aligned with business objectives.

- _Feature Development & Technical Execution_: Design, implementation, and deployment of full-stack features using Jakarta EE (JSF) and Oracle PL/SQL, translating complex business requirements into robust and scalable technical solutions.

- _Code Quality & Mentorship_: Maintaining and improving code quality by managing and conducting rigorous code reviews, establishing best practices (e.g., SOLID principles, Design Patterns), and mentoring fellow developers to elevate team-wide code integrity and knowledge.
