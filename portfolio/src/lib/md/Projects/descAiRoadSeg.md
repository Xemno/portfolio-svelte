# Computational Intelligence

The [Computational Intelligence Lab](https://www.vorlesungen.ethz.ch//Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=127561&semkez=2019S&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&lang=en), masters course at ETH ZÃ¼rich teaches fundamental concepts in computational science and machine learning with a special emphasis on matrix factorization and representation learning.
<br/><br/>

Part of the course if to work in a group of four people on the Road segmentation in aerial imagery application problem and develop a novel solution for it.
It was done as a team of four where the goal was to find a novel solution to the road segmentation of sattelite pictures. Our approach was to use image segmentation with a convolutional network architecture, based on the [U-Net](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/), where we stack the U-Net and perform the training using Keras on satellite image data.
<br/><br/>

## Image Data

Our data consisted of road images and their segmented labels. An example road and the corresponding label is shown here:
<!-- ![alt text](../images/chicago108.png "Satellite Image of a Chicago road") ![alt text](../images/label108.png "Corresponding segmented label") -->
