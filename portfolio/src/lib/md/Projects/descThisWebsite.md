I read this interesting quote the other day:

"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

`Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Culpa quod voluptatem saepe sapiente vitae necessitatibus blanditiis quidem veniam fugit. Tenetur deserunt fuga officiis delectus voluptate sunt, nihil molestiae fugiat inventore?
Reiciendis consectetur adipisci quaerat, quisquam, excepturi error veritatis corrupti omnis nihil minus soluta dolor autem pariatur. At, maiores explicabo ipsam delectus aliquid, assumenda commodi, modi velit minima atque suscipit odio.`

<p>

Svelte is :

- compiled : Svelte shifts as much work as possible out of the browser and into your build step. No more manual optimisations — just faster, more efficient apps.
- compact : Write breathtakingly concise components using languages you already know — HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Oh, and your application bundles will be tiny as well.
- complete : Built-in scoped styling, state management, motion primitives, form bindings and more — don't waste time trawling npm for the bare essentials. It's all here.

```ts
<script>
    let count = 1;
    $: doubled = count * 2;

<button on:click={() => count = count + 1}>Count</button>
```
