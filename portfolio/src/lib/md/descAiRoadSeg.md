This is a masters course project at the [Computational Intelligence Lab](https://www.vorlesungen.ethz.ch//Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=127561&semkez=2019S&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&lang=en), ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland taken in 2019. 

It was done as a team of four. 
The goal was to find a novel solution to the road segmentation of sattelite pictures. 


Our approach was to use image segmentation with a convolutional network architecture, based on the [U-Net](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/).
