# Freelance Web Development Project

In my free time, I developed a professional website for the automotive sales company [Drive GmbH](https://www.Dr1ve.ch), leveraging my skills in Svelte, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
The project involved creating a landing page for the company enabling customers to browse inventory, view services, and initiate WhatsApp-based inquiries.

## Key Contributions

- Developed a multilingual landing page (EN/DE/FR) for an automotive sales company, enabling customers to browse inventory, view services, and initiate WhatsApp-based inquiries.

- Implemented a responsive, mobile-first design with cross-browser compatibility, ensuring optimal UX across all devices (90+ Lighthouse scores).

- Integrated dynamic vehicle listings with filtering capabilities (by model, price, etc.) and direct CTA buttons to streamline customer engagement.

- Aligned UI/UX with brand guidelines through modern design elements (e.g., interactive galleries, animations) while maintaining fast load times,
