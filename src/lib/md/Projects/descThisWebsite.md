# Modern Interactive Portfolio Website

<p>In my free time, I, designed and developed a responsive, interactive portfolio using Svelte and TypeScript for a clean, type-safe codebase, enhanced with Three.js for immersive 3D visuals. </p> <br>

<p> Built as part of my exploration into full-stack development, demonstrating hands-on experience with these technologies.</p>

<p>This hands-on project deepened my expertise in frontend architecture, real-time graphics, and performance tuning—proving that powerful visuals and developer efficiency can coexist.</p>

## Key Contributions

- **Dynamic 3D Text Rendering**: Implemented a WebGL-based responsive text cloud particle system using Three.js, ensuring seamless adaptation to viewport constraints.

- **CSS-Aware 3D Graphics**: Synchronized 3D text positioning with DOM layout for device-independent scaling and alignment.

- **Cross-Device Optimization**: Applied adaptive sizing and orientation logic based on screen resolution, delivering smooth performance on desktop and mobile.

- **Efficient Architecture**: Leveraged Svelte’s reactivity for a high-performance component-based structure with minimal overhead.

- **Type-Safe Development**: Used TypeScript for maintainable, error-resistant code.

- **Interactive Visuals**: Enhanced engagement with optimized Three.js-driven effects (e.g., [specify: 3D models, particle systems, or interactive scenes]).

- **Deployment**: Deployed with GitHub Pages
